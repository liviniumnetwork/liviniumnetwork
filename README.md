# 👋 Hey, I'm Network

I'm a **self-taught hardware technician**, **server host**, and **Linux enthusiast** who loves building things, breaking them (on purpose.. ok fine not always on purpose), and learning by doing.

I run **bare metal servers**, 2 of them, powered by Linux, manage game infrastructure with **Pterodactyl**, and host **dedicated game servers** for myself, friends, and anyone else who wants to hop in.

## ⚙️ What I Work On
- 🛠️ Building, repairing & upgrading PCs and hardware
- 🐧 Managing Linux-based infrastructure across two bare metal servers
- 📦 Deploying and containerizing services with **Docker**
- 🎮 Hosting game servers (Minecraft, Valheim, etc.) via **Pterodactyl**
- 🧱 Exploring game engines like **Unreal Engine 4 & 5** and **Unity**
- 🌐 Strong understanding of networking and server setups

## 🚧 Currently Learning
- 🔧 **Modding Minecraft Java Edition** (Forge/Fabric, custom tools and Java in general)
- 🧠 Improving my skills in **Linux automation** and scripting
- 🎮 Diving deeper into **game development pipelines** and engine integration

## 🌐 Connect With Me
I'm always down to:
- Talk hardware or server setups
- Collaborate on game-related projects
- Help with Linux, Docker, or hosting tools
- Share Minecraft modding tips or server configs

> _"If it ain’t broke, tweak it anyway. If it breaks, well we can only learn from it."_ 😄
