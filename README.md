# 👋 Hey, I'm Network

I'm a **self-taught hardware technician**, **server host**, and **Linux enthusiast** who loves building things, breaking them (on purpose), and learning by doing.

I run **bare metal servers** powered by Linux, manage game infrastructure with **Pterodactyl**, and host **dedicated game servers** for myself, friends, and anyone else who wants to hop in.
